# LoadBalancing
This project aims to have in depth discussion about the various load balancing algorithms in distributed cloud system and analysis of which algorithm gives the best outcome.
# Idea
Creating virtual cloud machines using java cloud sim framework and distribute the the resources among the VMs and test various load balancing algorithms. 
# Front End
The front end is made using JavaFx framework of java language. The front end shows the performance analytics and the performance graphs of the selected algorithm. So that we can make a comparison between the algorithms.
# Back End
In the back end we are implementing the algorithms using cloudsim environment available for java language. And using this environment we are implementing the load balancing algorithms. The six algorithms.
# Results
Here we can see that the dynamic algorithms i.e. min-min and max-min algorithms are giving better performance than the static ones i.e. round-robin and random. And among all these Min-Min algorithm is giving the best performance.
# Scope
The future work includes try to simulate more load balancing algorithms to find if there any algorithm exists that performs better than min-min or max-min algorithm and make an automated application using machine learning to choose the best suited algorithm based on the requirements.
